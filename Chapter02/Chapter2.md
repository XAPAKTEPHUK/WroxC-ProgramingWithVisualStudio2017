# Chapter 2 WRITING A C# PROGRAM
## Visual Studio 2017 settings
### This book requires the C# development settings option, which you choose when you first run Visual Studio or by resetting the settings.
## Console applications
### Console applications are simple command-line applications, used in much of this book to illustrate techniques. Create a new console application with the Console Application template that you see when you create a new project in Visual Studio. To run a project in debug mode, use the Debug Start Debugging menu item, or press F5.
## IDE windows
### The project contents are shown in the Solution Explorer window. The properties of the selected item are shown in the Properties window. Errors are shown in the Error List window.
## Desktop applications
### Desktop applications are applications that have the look and feel of standard Windows applications, including the familiar icons to maximize, minimize, and close an application. They are created with the WPF Application template in the New Project dialog box.
