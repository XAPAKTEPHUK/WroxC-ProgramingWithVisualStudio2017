# Chapter 4 - FLOW CONTROL
## Boolean Logic
### Boolean logic involves using Boolean (true or false) values to evaluate conditions. Boolean operators are used to perform comparisons between values and return Boolean results. Some Boolean operators are also used to perform bitwise operations on the underlying bit structure of values, and there are some specialized bitwise operators too.
## Branching
### You can use Boolean logic to control program flow. The result of an expression that evaluates to a Boolean value can be used to determine whether a block of code is executed. You do this with if statements or the ?: (ternary) operator for simple branching, or the switch statement to check multiple conditions simultaneously.
## Looping
### Looping allows you to execute blocks of code a number of times according to conditions you specity. You can use do and while loops to execute code while a Boolean expression evaluates to true, and for loops to include a counter in your looping code. Loops can be interrupted by cycle (with continue) or completely (with break). Some loops end only if you interrupt them; these are called infinite loops.
