## Type Conversions
### You can convert values from one type into another, but there are rules that apply when you do so. Implicit conversion happens automatically, but only when all possible values of the source value type are available in the target value type. Explicit conversion is also possible, but you run the risk of values not being assigned as expected, or even causing errors.
## Enumerations 
### Enums, or enumerations, are types that have a discrete set of values, each of which has a name. Enums are defined with the enum keyword. This makes them easy to understand in code because they are very readable. Enums have an underlying numeric type (int by default), and you can use this property of enum values to convert between enum values and numeric values, or to identify enum values.
## Structs
### Structs, or structures, are types that contain several different values at the same time. Structs are defined with the struct keyword. The values contained in a struct each have a name and a type; there is no requirement that every value stored in a struct is the same type.
## Arrays
### An array is a collection of values of the same type. Arrays have a fixed size, or length, which determines how many values they can contain. You can define multidimensional or jagged arrays to hold different amounts and shapes of data. You can also iterate th rough the values in an array with a foreach loop.
