# Chapter 1 : INTRODUCING C#
## .NET Framework and .NET Core Fundamentals
### The .NET Framework is Microsoft's latest D development platform, and is currently in version 4.7. It includes a common type system (CST) and common language runtime (CLR/CoreCLR). Both .NET Framework and .NET Core applications are written using object-oriented programming (OOP) methology, and usually containmanaged code. Memory of managed code is handled by .NET runtime; this includes garbage collection.

## .NET FRamework Applications 
### Applications written using using .NET Framework are first compiled into Common Intermediate Language (CIL). When application is excecuted, the CLR uses Just-In-Time compiler (JIT) to compile this CIL into native code as required. Applications are compiled, and different parts are linked together into assemblies that contain the CIL. 

## .NET Core Applications
### .NET Core Applications work similar to .NET Framework applications; however, instead of using CLR it uses CoreCLR.

## .NET Standard
### .NET Standard provides a unified class library which can be targeted from multiple .NET platforms like .NET Framework, .NET COre, and Xamarin.

## C# Basics
### C# is one of the languages included int the .NET Framework. It is an evolution of previous languages such as C++, and can be used to write any number of applications, including web, cross-platform, and desktop applications.

## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) 
### You can use Visual Studio 2017 to write any type of .NET application using C#. You can also use the free, but less powerful, Community product to create .NET applications in C#. This IDE works with solutions, whic can consist of multiple projects.
