# Chapter 3 - VARIABLES AND EXPRESSIONS
## Basic C# syntax
### C# is a case-sensitive language, and each line of code is terminated with a semicolon. Lines can be indented for ease of reading if they get too long, or to identify nested blocks. You can include non-compiled comments with // or /* ... */ syntax. Blocks of code can be collapsed into regions, also to ease readability
## Variables
### Variables are chunks of data that have a name and a type. The .NET Framework defines plenty of simple types, such as numeric and string (text) types to use. Variables must be declared and initialized for you to use them. You can assign literal values to variables to initialize them, and variables can be declared and initialized in a single step. 
## Expressions
### Expressions are built from operators and operands, where operators perform operations on operands. There are three types of operators unary, binary, and ternary that operate on 1, 2, and 3 operands, respectively. Mathematical operators perform operations on numeric values, and assignment operators place the result of an expression into a variable. Operators have a fixed precedence that determines the order in which they are processed in an expression.
## Namespaces
### All names defined in a .NET application, including variable names, are contained in a namespace. Namespaces are hierarchical, and you often have to qualify names according to the namespace that contains them in order to access them.
